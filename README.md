# Deep-Learning-as-applied-to-Medical-Diagnostics
In an age of mass digitizing of cellular imaging, image processing is clinically relevant in its application to microscopic tissue images. Patients and medical professionals alike have great interest in the development of methods that are reliable and reproducible. Thus, in a field that traditionally has relied on the trained eye of a specialist to make diagnoses from a qualitative perspective, a transition is underway: computer-aided diagnosis is now possible with digitized imaging. By developing algorithmic methods which are reliable, reproducible and unsupervised, comes the presentation of a powerful tool that aids in the collection of data, assist researchers to further their understanding of the condition, and ultimately helps with the critical diagnosis of Glioblastoma.
